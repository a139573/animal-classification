    <h1 id="readme-practice-1">Readme Practice 1</h1>
    <p>In this README, we will explain where the data was obtained from, as well as list the libraries necessary to execute the files and how to run this project.</p>

    <h1 id="data-source">Data Source</h1>
    <p>The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. The dataset is titled <strong>Animal Image Dataset (90 Different Animals)</strong>. The dataset is available at the following URL: 
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals</a>. 
        This dataset contains 5400 animal images across 90 classes.
    </p>

    <h1 id="libraries-to-import">Libraries to import</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Torch</li>
        <li>Torchvision</li>
        <li>PIL</li>
        <li>pathlib</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="what-the-project-do">What the project does</h1>
    <p>The goal of this project is to develop a model capable of identifying which of the 90 animals is depicted in a given image. The model will be trained on a portion of the dataset to learn features that distinguish between different animals. Once trained, the model should be able to accurately classify previously unseen images.</p>

    <h1 id="how-to-run-the-project">How to run the project</h1>
    <p>Download the project folder and open the Jupyter Notebook named <em>Project 1 Animals Image Dataset</em>. Run all cells to execute the project.</p>

    <h1 id="how-to-train-the-model">How to train the model</h1>
    <p>Run the following command from the project root folder: <code>python -m my_projects.modeling.train</code>. This trains the model on a subsample containing 6% of the data.</p>

    <h1 id="how-to-generate-predictions">How to generate predictions</h1>
    <p>Run the following command from the project root folder: <code>python -m my_projects.modeling.inference</code>.</p>

    <h1 id="environment-used">Environment used</h1>
    <p>The project environment is Anaconda. The environment <code>py311ml</code> was used.</p>
