Script to clean dataset folders by deleting specific files.

This script iterates through subdirectories of a root data folder
(e.g., class folders like 'cat', 'dog') and deletes files
whose names match a specific regex pattern.

It is designed to remove files that may be artifacts from a renaming
process, such as "cat_1.jpg", "lion_12.png", etc.

Notes
-----
The variables `root_dir` and `pattern` must be set manually
within this script before execution.
